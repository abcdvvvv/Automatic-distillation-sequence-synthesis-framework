# Automatic distillation sequence synthesis framework

This is a framework for automated distillation sequence synthesis using Aspen Plus and MATLAB.

<img src="https://github.com/abcdvvvv/Automatic-distillation-sequence-synthesis-framework/blob/master/images/github2.png" width="600">

This program is for development use only and does not have any graphical user interface. The user should have at least a basic knowledge of MATLAB programming and a background in chemical engineering.

## Requirements

Aspen Plus: V11 or higher

MATLAB: 2022a or above

MATLAB Optimization Toolbox™

## User Guide

The user needs to download the entire code package to run the program.

1. Prepare a simulation file. The user needs to define the components needed first. Then draw a feed stream in the flowchart screen and enter the name of that stream in main.m (feedstream).
2. Create a new item in the property set of Aspen Plus, named PS-1, to analyze the mixture's vaporization heat (DHVLMX) in kJ/kmol.
3. Place this file in /simulation file/baseFile and enter the name of the file into main.m (basefile).

### main.m

This function creates a distillation sequence superstructure using the preorder traversal algorithm and the DSTWU model. The program will try to execute the simulation. If the simulation is error-free, it will adjust the parameters and then use the simulation results to formulate the MILP problem. Note that all separations are sharp separations.

There are five user-specified parameters in this function
```
basefile = 'case3.bkp';
feedstream = 'R1-1';    % The stream name entering the separation section
max_solution = 1;       % How many optimal solutions to generate
regression = 0;         % 1:regress CAPEX on F; 0:Calculate only CAPEX(y), independent of F
heat_integration = 0;   % Heat integration
exheatflow = struct( ...% Heat integration for adding external heat flow
    'Ti',{30,300}, ...  % input temperature
    'To',{35,200}, ...  % output temperature
    'Q', {2000,-1000}); % duty
work_dir = fullfile('D:','distillation',filesep); % Setting up the working directory
```
**max_solution** controls how many optimal solutions the program solves for. Generally more than 4 may result in no solution.

**regression** = 1 was used to calculate the relationship between feed flow F and CAPEX using linear regression. No regression when it equals 0.

Heat integration is calculated for **heat_integration** = 1 and not calculated for 0. The code for heat integration is not yet complete and in some cases it is not possible to derive feasible solutions. To be fixed.

**exheatflow** is a variable that can append an external heat exchanger, or delete the contents of this structure if there is no external heat exchanger. For example `'Ti',{},...`

**work_dir** allows you to set your own working directory. The program will create files in that directory. It is also acceptable to use an array of strings to represent the directory, for example `work_dir='d:/distillation/'`. Remember to add the slash at the end.

If you want to turn on automatic column pressure adjustment, you must set up an additional physical property analysis in Aspen, they are

- Critical temperature of the mixture (TCMX) in °C. Set this item in PS-2.
- Bubble point pressure and dew point pressure (PBUB and PDEW) in bar. Set up these two items in PS-3.

This script pops up a graph after running, which shows the sensitivity analysis of the heating utility to the optimal solution.

### name2struct.m

Use this file to define the components or groups to be separated. Please refer to sample case3.bkp for the format. Non-products are defined as 0, pure substance products are defined as 1, and mixture products are defined as 2.

You can specify the default pressure and the default recovery rate with the structure `gen_rule{1}`. You can also specify the recovery rate for a substance.

If you want to use more than one set of utilities, specify the set of utilities in this file, e.g. `utility_set=2;` then define them in utilities.m. 

### main2.m

The script redeploys the optimal distillation sequence using the Radfrac model and optimizes it using an improved quadratic interpolation algorithm.

main2.m and main.m are separate, but main2.m needs to use the workspace variables generated by main.m. One way is to run main2.m without closing MATLAB after running main.m. Another way is to run main2.m by loading the .mat file that was generated the last time you ran main.m. For the second way, you can load the file manually (e.g., case1.mat) before running main2.m.

The user can choose which distillation sequences to redeploy by changing the loop range in `for d=1:1`. (For example, `d=2:2` deploys only the second-best solution, and `d=1:3` deploys the top three)

### Output

All the results of the calculations are stored in a spreadsheet called **output.xlsx**.

If you successfully run through main.m, you will get all the data in the list, including solution1(2,3) and TAC. You will get the capital cost data for the Radfrac columns only if you run through main2.m.
